university diploma project

DailyLog is an internal web application for companies that helps employees efficiently manage their daily work reports and notifications to their bosses.

## Main features:
  # Daily reports: 
  Every employee can record their tasks and achievements at the end of the day. This helps supervisors track the progress of the team and maintain transparency of      work performance.

  # Absence Notifications: 
  Employees can send notifications of planned absences, including requests for leave or unforeseen circumstances such as illness. The notification is sent      directly to the manager or approver in charge.

  # Leave Requests: 
  The app simplifies the leave request process with start and end dates and the ability to track the status of the request (pending, approved, denied).

  # Approval of Requests: 
  Managers or designees (upruvers) are notified of absence or leave requests and can quickly approve or deny them through the app, speeding up workflow and      eliminating unnecessary bureaucracy.

## Benefits:
  # Transparency: 
  The app provides a clear picture of employees' working hours and the status of requests in real time.
  # Automation: 
  Simplifies the process of submitting leave requests or absence notifications, reducing the burden on managers.
  # Ease of Use: 
  Intuitive interface makes the application easy to use for both employees and management.
  # History of reports and requests: 
  All data is stored and users can view the history of their reports or queries at any time.
  
  DailyLog is a handy tool to keep employees and managers productive and engaged, ensuring transparency and efficiency within the company.
